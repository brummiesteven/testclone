# Challenge 01: Visualise Work & Communication  
_Duration: XX minutes_  

Before we start to look at technical practices in our project we need to think about how we will communicate as a product team.  The aims of this challenge are: 

- Decide the artefacts the team will use to track work in the project and what information will they contain.
- Visualise the flow of work from inception through to value delivery to the user.
- Gather and action feedback within the project  
- Track progress of a release, product or feature
- Integrate development with a messaging platform such as Microsoft Teams

## Task 1: GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues can be used to to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, feedback or bugs for work on GitHub.  All Issues can be assigned to a user or users and can be tagged to allow quicker searching or grouped together in milestones.

a) Create GitHub Issue templates to track the following:

- Tasks
- Bugs
- Customer feedback

| :question: What information do you require for each Issue type? :question: |
| --- |

b) Create some useful labels and apply them to your Issues and then [experiment with searching Issues by label](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label)

## Task 2: Project Boards

Visualise all of your work and prioritize it right alongside your code with projects boards. See what tasks are planned or in-progress, either in a repository or across your organization.  You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.

a) Create a repository level project board that we will use to track future tasks for your team.  Choose `Automated kanban with review` for your board template.

_Repository project boards are scoped to issues and pull requests within a single repository. They can also include notes that reference issues and pull requests in other repositories_

b) **TODO**  Add another step to this task.  Edit board?   

## Extension: Azure Boards/Jira/Trello integration

- Integrate with the task management tool of choice in your organisation.

## Extension: Microsoft Teams integration

- Integrate your GitHub repository with Microsoft Teams (you _could_ also use Slack for this step)

**TODO** Investigate Office 365 dev subscription for this step if attendees do not have Teams admin rights.
