# Challenge 01: Visualise Work & Communication  
_Duration: XX minutes_  

## Challenge Objectives

- [ ] Create a GitHub Issue for each objective across the six challenges [csv](http://www.github.com)
- [ ] Add a Label to each Issue to indicate which challenge it belongs to 
- [ ] Create an `Automated Kanban with review` Repository level project board and include all open Issues
- [ ] Add an Issue template to track `Customer feedback`

## Introduction

Before we start to look at technical practices in our project we need to think about how we will communicate as a product team.  The aims of this challenge are: 

- Decide the artefacts the team will use to track work in the project and what information will they contain.
- Visualise the flow of work from inception through to value delivery to the user.
- Gather and action feedback within the project  
- Track progress of a release, product or feature
- Integrate development with a messaging platform such as Microsoft Teams

## Task 1: GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues can be used to to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, feedback or bugs for work on GitHub.  All Issues can be assigned to a user or users and can be tagged to allow quicker searching or grouped together in milestones.

a) Create GitHub Issue templates to track the following:

- Tasks
- Bugs
- Customer feedback

| :question: What information do you require for each Issue type? :question: |
| --- |

b) Add an Issue for each challenge objective.  You can do this as you work through each challenge or add them all now.  Here is a useful [csv](http://www.github.com) list which also include extensions to the core challenges.

c) Ensure you add a labels to each Issue to indicate which challenge it relates to.

d) Create some more useful labels and apply them to your Issues and then [experiment with searching Issues by label](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label)

## Task 2: Project Boards

Visualise all of your work and prioritize it right alongside your code with projects boards. See what tasks are planned or in-progress, either in a repository or across your organization.  You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.

a) Create a repository level project board that we will use to track future tasks for your team.  Choose `Automated kanban with review` for your board template.

_Repository project boards are scoped to issues and pull requests within a single repository. They can also include notes that reference issues and pull requests in other repositories_

b) Review the automation for each column.  When will Issues and PRs automatically move to each column? 

c) Edit the project board you created in the previous step, update the description and ensure you have selected `Track project progress`   

d) Add a new note to your project board in the **ToDo** column: `Remember to grab a coffee and stretch your legs`
