## Introduction

This DevOps Hack project is designed to help attendees learn about good DevOps practices with GitHub for deploying to Azure.  

In [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339), authors Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim present research that surfaces the key technical and management practices that high-performing DevOps teams have adopted and continue to refine.

We have used the practices listed by the authors under the heading of **Continuous Delivery** to guide the challenges in this hack.  High-performing DevOps teams have adopted many of these practices to help them achieve a continuous delivery model.

- Version Control
- Deployment automation
- Continuous integration (CI)
- Trunk-based development
- Test automation
- Test data management
- Shift left on security (DevSecOps)
- Continuous delivery (CD)

## Pre-requisites

- Oraganise yourself into teams if you haven't already.  GitHub is all about social coding!
- Create a GitHub account or login to an existing one
- Decide who will host the repository for your team
- Create an Azure Account (although in the deployment challenge, feel free to deploy to multiple cloud environments)
- Fork [this](https://github.com) repo into a **public** repo within your chosen GitHub account

## Agenda

The exercise is broken down into six challenges.  Most challenges can be worked on independently but we would encourage you to follow the suggested order.  All challenges can be complete using existing GitHub and Azure functionality but feel free to go off piste and incorporate your favourite DevOps tooling to make the exercise more relevant to your organisation.

### Visualise work

GitHub provides Issues and Project Boards to enable you to track your project requirements.  

### Development Practices

How will your team work together collaboratively and ensure a high quality release?

### Continuous Integration

In this challenge we will build our application ready for deployment to our chosen location.  

### Security, Test automation & test data management

With many developers working on our project, we want to make sure that a high bar or security and quality is maintained. 

### Automated deployment and continuous delivery

Deploy your application to multiple Azure environments

### Monitoring & feedback

Maintain a feedback loop from your running application and end users.  Automate the process to drive project priorities and react to issues quickly.
